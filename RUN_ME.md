# ðŸš€ AUTONOMOUS SETUP - PortA

Your tokens are configured and everything is ready!

## Run this single command:

```bash
cd /Users/marcschwyn/Desktop/projects/porta && npm install && node setup-autonomous.js
```

## What will happen automatically:

1. âœ… Create complete Next.js application
2. âœ… Set up Supabase database backend  
3. âœ… Create GitHub repository
4. âœ… Deploy to Vercel
5. âœ… Configure all environment variables
6. âœ… Give you a LIVE URL in ~3-5 minutes

## After setup completes:

You'll see:
- Your live app URL (https://porta.vercel.app)
- Dashboard links for Vercel, GitHub, and Supabase
- Everything configured and ready to use

## If anything fails:

Check `deployment-results.json` for partial results.
