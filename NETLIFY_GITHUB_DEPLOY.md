# ðŸš€ Netlify GitHub Deployment (Recommended!)

## Yes! Netlify's GitHub integration is actually BETTER than Vercel's!

### Quick Deploy (2 minutes):

1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com/start
2. **Click**: "Import an existing project"
3. **Choose**: "Deploy with GitHub"
4. **Authorize** Netlify to access GitHub (if first time)
5. **Search** for: `porta`
6. **Select**: `Masssa75/porta`
7. **Netlify auto-detects** Next.js settings!
8. **Click**: "Deploy site"

### What Netlify Will Auto-Configure:
- âœ… Build command: `npm run build`
- âœ… Publish directory: `.next`
- âœ… Node version: Auto-detected
- âœ… Environment variables: You can add them in UI

### Why This Is Perfect:
- **Automatic deploys** on every push to GitHub
- **Preview deploys** for pull requests
- **No root directory confusion** (unlike Vercel)
- **Better build logs**
- **Free custom domains**

### After Deploy:
1. Add environment variables:
   - Go to Site settings â†’ Environment variables
   - Add your Supabase keys from `.env.local`

2. Custom domain (optional):
   - Site settings â†’ Domain management
   - Add `porta.com` or keep `porta.netlify.app`
