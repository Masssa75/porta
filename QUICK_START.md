# 🚀 Quick Start - PortA

## If you see the Node.js REPL prompt (>):
Type `.exit` and press Enter to exit first!

## Then run ONE of these commands:

### Option 1: Enhanced version (recommended)
```bash
node setup-autonomous-v2.js
```

### Option 2: Original version
```bash
node setup-autonomous.js
```

## What you'll see:
1. Prerequisites check ✅
2. Step-by-step progress (1/6, 2/6, etc.)
3. Live URL when complete!

## If it fails:
- Check `deployment-results-partial.json` to see where it stopped
- The enhanced version (v2) has better error handling and retries

## Success looks like:
```
✨ PROJECT SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED! ✨
🌐 Your app is LIVE at: https://porta.vercel.app

**Remember**: Exit Node REPL first if you see the `>` prompt!
