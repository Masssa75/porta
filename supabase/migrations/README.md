# Database Migration Guide

## Overview

These migrations optimize the tweet storage system for handling millions of tweets across thousands of projects.

## Migration Files

### 1. `000_immediate_optimizations.sql` - Start Here! âœ…
**Safe to run immediately** - No data migration required

This migration adds:
- Performance indexes for common queries
- Full-text search capability
- Useful views for analytics
- Functions for data cleanup and summaries

**To apply:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the entire file
3. Run the query
4. Takes ~1-2 seconds

### 2. `001_optimize_tweet_storage.sql` - Advanced (Future) ðŸš€
**Requires careful planning** - Implements table partitioning

This migration:
- Converts tweet_analyses to a partitioned table (by month)
- Creates automatic partition management
- Adds archival system for old tweets
- Creates materialized views for performance
- **Warning:** Requires data migration and downtime

**When to use:**
- When you have >1 million tweets
- When query performance degrades
- Plan for ~30 min downtime for migration

## Performance Benefits

### With Immediate Optimizations:
- 10-100x faster project-specific queries
- Sub-second searches even with millions of rows
- Full-text search capability
- Easy duplicate removal

### With Full Partitioning:
- Linear performance regardless of table size
- Automatic old data management
- 1000x faster time-range queries
- Easy backup/restore of specific periods

## Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Check index usage
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan as index_scans,
    idx_tup_read as tuples_read,
    idx_tup_fetch as tuples_fetched
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Check table size
SELECT 
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('tweet_analyses')) as total_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('tweet_analyses')) as table_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_indexes_size('tweet_analyses')) as indexes_size;

-- Check row count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_tweets FROM tweet_analyses;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always backup before migrations**
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase Dashboard
   pg_dump -t tweet_analyses > backup.sql
   ```

2. **Test queries after migration**
   ```sql
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
   SELECT * FROM tweet_analyses 
   WHERE project_id = 'your-uuid' 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Monitor performance**
   - Use the views for common queries
   - Check pg_stat_user_tables regularly
   - Set up alerts for slow queries

## Rollback Plan

For immediate optimizations:
```sql
-- Drop indexes if needed
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_tweet_project_created;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_tweet_project_importance;
-- etc...

-- Drop views
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_recent_important_tweets CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_daily_tweet_stats CASCADE;
```

For partitioning migration:
- Keep the `tweet_analyses_old` table until fully verified
- Can revert by renaming tables back
